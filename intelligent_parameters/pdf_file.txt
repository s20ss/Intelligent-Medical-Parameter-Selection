Background: Studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) make up the major 
proportion of the ceRNA network and can regulate gene expression by competitively binding 

to miRNAs. This reveals the existence of an RNA-miRNA regulatory pathway and is of great 

biological significance. CeRNAs, as competitive endogenous RNAs, have revealed a new 

mechanism of interaction between RNAs. Until now, the role of lncRNA-mediated ceRNAs in 

breast cancer and their regulatory mechanisms have been elucidated to some extent. 

Purpose: In this study, comprehensive analysis of large-scale invasive breast cancer samples in 
TCGA were conducted to further explore the developmental mechanism of invasive breast cancer 

and the potential predictive markers for invasive breast cancer prognosis in the ceRNA network.

Methods: Abnormal expression profiles of invasive breast cancer associated mRNAs, lncRNAs 
and miRNAs were obtained from the TCGA database. Through further alignment and predic-

tion of target genes, an abnormal lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network was constructed 

for invasive breast cancer. Through the overall survival analysis, Identification prognostic bio-

markers for invasive breast cancer patients，In addition, we used Cytoscape plug-in BinGo for 

the different mRNA performance functional cluster analysis.

Results: Differential analysis revealed that 1059 lncRNAs, 86 miRNAs, and 2138 mRNAs 
were significantly different in invasive breast cancer samples versus normal samples. Then we 

construct an abnormal lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network for invasive breast cancer, 

consisting of 90 DElncRNAs, 18 DEmiRNAs and 26 DEmRNAs.Further, 4 out of 90 lncRNAs, 

3 out of 26 mRNAs, and 2 out of 18 miRNAs were useful as prognostic biomarkers for invasive 

breast cancer patients (P value < 0.05). It is worth noting that based on the ceRNA network, we 

found that the LINC00466-Hsa-mir-204- NTRK2 LINC00466-hsa-mir-204-NTRK2 axis was 

present in 9 RNAs associated with the prognosis of invasive breast cancer. 

Conclusion: This study provides an effective bioinformatics basis for further understanding 
of the molecular mechanism of invasive breast cancerand for predicting outcomes, which can 

guide the use of  invasive breast cancerdrugs and subsequent related research.

Introduction
Breast cancer, as the most frequent cancer affecting women worldwide, has strong 

invasiveness and metastatic qualities,1 and the incidence and mortality rate of breast 

cancer continue to increase.2 Currently, chemotherapy and surgery are the main treat-

ment methods for breast cancer.3 However, because of the high rate of tumor recurrence 

and resistance to chemotherapy, the therapeutic effect and prognosis of breast cancer

have always failed to achieve satisfactory results.4 Therefore, 

an in-depth understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of 

breast cancer and the identification of new candidate thera-

peutic targets and biomarkers is urgently needed for breast 

cancer treatment.

This in-depth study on the molecular pathogenesis of 

tumors based on bioinformatics analysis exploits an impor-

tant method for tumor research. It can not only explore the 

molecular pathogenesis of tumors in depth but also identify 

novel biomarkers for the onset and prognosis of tumors.5 

The screening of biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis 

of breast cancer has a crucial role in the early diagnosis of 

breast cancer, in improving the prognosis of breast cancer 

and reducing breast cancer mortality.

In recent years, suff icient research evidence has 

shown that lncRNAs play key roles in the physiological 

and pathological processes of various organisms, such 

as embryonic development, organogenesis, and tumori-

genesis.6 lncRNAs function as ceRNAs to communicate 

with mRNAs by competing for shared miRNAs and many 

lncRNAs serve as master regulators that affect the expres-

sion levels of dozens or even hundreds of target genes.7–9 

A large number of studies have shown that the abnormal 

expression of ceRNAs is closely related to the occurrence, 

development, and prognosis of tumors, including breast 

cancer,10 For example, Zheng et al11 found that activation 

of the STARD13-associated ceRNA network attenu-

ates YAP/TAZ nuclear accumulation and transcriptional 

activity in breast cancer by co-modulating Hippo and 

Rho-GTPase/F-actin signaling and proposed the possibil-

ity of promoting the inhibition of breast cancer stem cell 

traits via the STARD13-associated ceRNA network. Li et 

al found that growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5), 

as a ceRNA-antagonizing tumor promoter of miR-196a-

5p-expressing triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, 

can suppress TNBC progression by competitively binding 

miR-196a-5p and, therefore, GAS5 may be a prognostic 

biomarker of TNBC.12

ceRNA networks can link the function of protein-coding 

mRNAs with the function of ncRNAs, such as miRNAs and 

lncRNAs.10 In this study, we first obtained meaningful dif-

ferentially expressed lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs based 

on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (https://

cancergenome.nih.gov/). Subsequently, by comparing, 

predicting, and integrating differentially expressed RNAs, 

we constructed a differentially expressed lncRNA–miRNA–

mRNA ceRNA network for invasive breast cancer. Finally, to 

bring the results closer to the clinical treatment of invasive 

breast cancer, we performed an overall survival analysis of 

lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in the ceRNA network to 

identify invasive breast cancer-related prognostic biomark-

ers. Through this study, we can not only further understand 

the molecular mechanism of invasive breast cancer but also 

provide potential lncRNA, miRNA and mRNA diagnostic 

biomarkers for invasive breast cancer, which will contribute 

to the early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of invasive 

breast cancer.

Methods
Data processing and differential 
expression analysis
TCGA database provides the analysis of high-throughput 

data for various genomic changes, including the expression 

data of mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA. By combining bioin-

formatics analysis with the clinical information of patients, 

it lays the foundation for improving cancer prevention and 

the early detection and treatment of diseases. In this study, 

from TCGA database, we downloaded expression data on 

mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA from invasive breast cancer. 

Among them, mRNA and lncRNA expression data from 

1,208 samples, including 112 normal samples and 1,096 

invasive breast cancer samples, and miRNA expression data 

from 1,193 samples, including 103 normal samples and 1,090 

invasive breast cancer samples, were acquired. Based on the 

edger software package, the downloaded data were normal-

ized and analyzed for differences to obtain differentially 

expressed lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA molecules. The 

relevant data provided by TCGA are publicly available and 

open-ended and, therefore, do not require the approval of the 

local ethics committee.

Prediction of lncRna–miRna and 
miRna–mRna interactions
miRcode (http://www.mircode.org/)13 provides “whole tran-

scriptome” human miRNA target predictions based on the 

comprehensive GENCODE gene annotation. In this study, 

miRcode online software was used to predict the interac-

tion between lncRNAs and miRNAs and DElncRNAs and 

DEmiRNAs that could be compared successfully were 

obtained. In addition, the target mRNAs of miRNAs were 

predicted using TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org/),14 

miRDB (http://www.mirdb.org/miRDB/),15 and miRTarBase 

(http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw)16 online analysis tools. 

To further improve the reliability of bioinformatics analy-

sis, a Venny diagram was used to obtain the portion of the

ceRna networks in invasive breast cancer

target mRNA that overlaps with the differentially expressed 

mRNA in invasive breast cancer and was further analyzed 

as DEmRNA. Finally, we established matched DElncRNA–

DEmiRNA and DEmiRNA–DEmRNA pairs.

Construction of the DelncRna–
DemiRna–DemRna ceRna network
Based on the relationships between DElncRNAs, DEmiRNAs, 

and DEmRNAs and the obtained DElncRNA–DEmiRNA and 

DEmiRNA–DEmRNA pairs, we used Cytoscape v3.017 to 

construct and visualize the DElncRNA–DEmiRNA–DEm-

RNA ceRNA network. Cytoscape is an open source software 

platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks and 

biological pathways and integrating these networks with 

annotations, gene expression profiles, and other state data. 

Cytoscape plug-in (BNGO)18 provides a comprehensive set 

of functional annotation tools for investigators to understand 

the biological meaning behind Gene Ontology (GO) and the 

Kyoto Encyclopedia list of genes. To further understand the 

function of these differentially expressed genes, functional 

enrichment analysis was performed using the Cytoscape 

plugin BiNGO, which involves the following three parts: 

molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), and cel-

lular component (CC). P<0.05 was selected as the cutoff 
condition when GO conditions were selected.

associations of DelncRnas, DemiRnas, 
and DemRnas and patient prognosis
Each sample in TCGA was independent of each other, and it 

contained all sample data, such as gene expression, prognosis, 

and survival time. From TCGA database, we obtained clinical 

information about invasive breast cancer and combined the 

expression data of DElncRNAs, DEmiRNAs, and DEmRNAs 

with the clinical data. Cox regression analysis of survival 

packages and Kaplan–Meier curves was used to assess the 

relationship between the expression of DElncRNAs, DEmiR-

NAs, and DEmRNAs and invasive breast cancer patients’ 

overall survival. In addition, DElncRNAs, DEmiRNAs, and 

DEmRNAs that were significantly associated with overall 

survival were identified as prognostic biomarkers.

Results
TCga-related data analysis and 
differential expression analysis
We calculated mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA expression 

profiles between invasive breast cancer samples and nonma-

lignant samples obtained from TCGA. Based on the relevant 

limma software package, data on differential expression 

were extracted and analyzed. Using log 2-fold change ≥2.0 
and P-value <0.01 as screening cutoff conditions, 2,138 dif-
ferentially expressed mRNAs, 1,059 differentially expressed 

lncRNAs, and 86 differentially expressed miRNAs were 

screened out (Supplementary Tables 1–3). Among them, 

the 2,138 differentially expressed mRNAs included 1,375 

upregulated mRNAs and 763 downregulated mRNAs and 

the 1,059 differentially expressed lncRNAs included 842 

upregulated lncRNAs and 217 downregulated lncRNAs. In 

addition, 86 differentially expressed miRNAs contained 67 

upregulated miRNAs and 19 downregulated miRNAs. Cluster 

analysis of RNA heat maps and volcano diagrams are shown 

in Figures 1–3.

Matching of DelncRna–DemiRna and 
prediction of DemiRna–DemRna 
interactions
Based on the miRcode online software, we predicted and 

compared DElncRNA–DEmiRNA pairs and found success-

ful comparisons of 90 DElncRNAs and 18 DEmiRNAs. 

The target genes of 18 DEmiRNAs were predicted using 

TargetScan, miRDB, and miRTarBase target gene predic-

tion software. The target genes predicted by the three online 

software packages were simultaneously used as prediction 

results for target genes of DEmiRNAs, and finally, 506 target 

genes were obtained. To obtain a differentially expressed 

miRNA–mRNA interaction pair in invasive breast cancer, 

the predicted target gene was matched with differentially 

expressed mRNAs and the results showed that 26 DEmRNAs 

could be successfully matched with DEmiRNAs. Finally, 323 

DElncRNA–DEmiRNA pairs and 28 DEmiRNA–DEmRNA 

interaction pairs were obtained.

Construction of the ceRna network and 
functional enrichment analysis
To further explore the mechanism of invasive breast cancer 

development, a ceRNA network was constructed based on 

the interactions of 323 DElncRNA–DEmiRNA pairs and 

28 DEmiRNA–DEmRNA pairs between 90 DElncRNAs, 

18 DEmiRNAs, and 26 DEmRNAs. We used Cytoscape to 

visualize the network (Figure 4). To further understand the 

functional role of DEmRNAs in invasive breast cancer, we 

used the BiNGO plugin for functional enrichment analysis 

of these DEmRNAs. The results showed that the DEmRNAs 

were particularly rich in the MF, BP, and cell components’ clas-

sifications. In the BP group, these genes were mainly enriched

in the regulation of DNA-dependent transcription, the RNA 

metabolic process, and gene expression, among others (Figure 

5A). The MF was mainly enriched in multiple binding, such 

as chromatin DNA binding, DNA regulatory region binding, 

transcription regulator activity, and transcription factor bind-

ing (Figure 5B). In addition, CC terms were mainly involved 

in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm (Figure 5C).

Prognostic overall survival assessment of 
lncRnas, miRnas, and mRnas
Survival analysis based on a survival package found 

that using P<0.05 as the screening criteria, 4 lncRNAs 
(AC007731.1, AL356479.1, LINC00460, and LINC00466) 

among 90 DElncRNAs were closely associated with the 

overall survival of invasive breast cancer patients. High 

expression of LINC00460 and LINC00466 was associated 

with high survival rates. For AC007731.1, however, low 

expression was associated with a high survival rate. The effect 

of AL356479.1 on the survival rate of patients changed over 

time. High expression during the early stage was associated 

with a higher survival rate. Two of the 18 DEmiRNAs (hsa-

mir-204 and hsa-mir-301b) were associated with prognosis. 

High expression of hsa-mir-204 suggested a long survival 

time, while high expression of hsa-mir-301b suggested that 

the survival time was relatively short. In addition, among the 

26 DEmRNAs, 3 mRNAs (KPNA2, NTRK2, and SFRP1) 

were associated with overall survival. High expression of 

NTRK2 and SFRP1 and low expression of KPNA2 showed an 

association with a higher survival rate (Figure 6). It is worth 

noting that based on the ceRNA network, we found that the 

LINC00466–hsa-mir-204–NTRK2 axis was linked to nine 

RNAs associated with the prognosis of invasive breast cancer.

Discussion
As one of the most invasive malignant tumors in women, 

it is very urgent and meaningful to deeply explore the 

molecular pathogenesis of breast cancer. In this study, we 

used bioinformatics analysis of the invasive breast cancer-

associated lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA ceRNA network to 

study the molecular pathogenesis of invasive breast cancer. 

We obtained a total of 90 DElncRNAs, 18 DEmiRNAs, and 

26 DEmRNAs, and by analyzing overall survival, 4 lncRNAs 

(AC007731, AL356479, LINC00460, and LINC00466), 2 

miRNAs (hsa-mir-204 and hsa-mir-301b), and 3 mRNAs 

(KPNA2, NTRK2, and SFRP1) were found to be associated 

with overall survival in invasive breast cancer patients.

To further investigate the cellular mechanisms involved 

in invasive breast cancer, GO analysis of 26 DEmRNAs 

was performed. GO analysis indicated that DEmRNAs were 

mainly enriched in single-cell proliferation and apoptosis, 

including DNA-dependent transcription, the processes of 

RNA metabolism, chromatin DNA binding, DNA regula-

tory region binding, transcriptional regulation activity, and 

transcription factor binding, and cytoplasm and nucleoplasm 

were associated with gene mutations and the malignant pro-

liferation of invasive breast cancer cells, which are consistent 

with the findings of current invasive breast cancer research.

The lncRNAs are ncRNA molecules with lengths >200 

nucleotides. They do not participate in the coding of proteins, 

but they play an important role in the physiological and 

pathological processes of the human body.19 Studies have 

found that the main functions of lncRNAs occur through 

their interactions with miRNAs, mainly through miRNA 

binding to silence the miRNA, thereby indirectly regulating 

mRNA, DNA, and protein expressions. In humans, lncRNAs 

are involved in chromosomal rearrangements, gene expres-

sion, cell development, proliferation, apoptosis, and other 

physiological and pathological processes.20 In recent years, 

many studies have found that lncRNAs play a crucial role in 

the molecular pathogenesis of cancer and that the molecular 

mechanisms of action of lncRNA in breast cancer and other 

cancers, chromatin modification, and DNA methylation are 

key epigenetic events that are fundamentally disturbed during 

the development of cancer.21,22

In this study, we analyzed the overall survival rate of 

patients associated with DElncRNAs in the ceRNA network. 

We screened four lncRNAs that correlated with the prognosis 

of patients with invasive breast cancer. It is noteworthy that 

among the four lncRNAs, LINC00460 has been confirmed 

to be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of many kinds 

of tumors and has a strong relationship with the occurrence, 

development, proliferation, metastasis, and prognosis of

cancer. Xing et al,23 using luciferase reporter gene assays and 

Western blot analysis, revealed that LINC00460 promotes 

MMP-9 expression by targeting miR-539, thereby acting as 

an oncogenic RNA in malignant meningiomas and accelerat-

ing the proliferation and metastasis of meningiomas. Using 

real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions, Transwell 

assays, Western blots, and immunofluorescence assays, the 

researchers found that the interference of LINC00460 expres-

sion could inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration of 

non-small-cell cancers and interference with the expression 

of LINC00460 could affect epithelial–mesenchymal transi-

tion (EMT)-related proteins. The expression changes were 

used to confirm that LINC00460 could affect tumor invasion 

and migration by affecting EMT, so LINC00460’s expression 

had potential in the prognosis and treatment of non-small-cell 

lung cancer patients.24,25 In addition, LINC00460 has been 

proven to have roles in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 

laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carci-

noma, and other malignant tumors. It can be used as a new 

biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis and may have great 

value in guiding clinical treatment.26–28 However, although 

we identified four lncRNAs that were closely related to the 

diagnosis and prognosis of invasive breast cancers using the 

bioinformatics analysis, the complex molecular regulation 

mechanisms among them require further clinical trials.

The important role of miRNAs in posttranscriptional 

gene regulation reveals another fine-tuning step in the 

expression of genetic information. The cellular pathways 

involved in the regulation of miRNAs play an important role 

in the physiological and pathological processes of the body’s 

development. At the molecular level, miRNAs inhibit protein 

production by affecting the stability of their target mRNAs 

and/or by downregulating their translation.29 Although the 

number of miRNAs is very small, miRNAs can participate in 

the regulation of cell development, proliferation, apoptosis, 

differentiation, and metabolism.30 Increasing numbers of 

studies have shown that abnormal miRNA expression can 

participate in many types of cancer.31,32 Breast cancer is one 

of these cancers, and miRNA can either act as an oncogene 

or tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer.33 Therefore, as a 

key factor in signal cascades, miRNAs are potentially useful 

biomarkers in clinical diagnosis and may become targets and 

tools for cancer treatment development.34

In this study, we have identified two miRNAs related 

to the diagnosis and prognosis of invasive breast cancer, 

including hsa-mir-204 and hsa-mir-301b. Shen et al,35 using

ceRna networks in invasive breast cancer

real-time qPCR, MTT assay, flow cytometry, and Western 

blot analysis, found that miR-204 regulates the biological 

behavior of breast cancer cells through direct targeting of 

FOXA1, including cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, 

and apoptosis. In addition, hsa-mir-204 can be used to predict 

the outcomes of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, 

lung adenocarcinoma, and other cancers.32,36 Fort et al37 found 

that the correlation between hsa-miR-301b and candidate 

target genes supports it having a role in the inhibition of 

tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer, indicating the 

oncogenic role of miR-301b in prostate cancer. In addition, 

these researchers also found that hsa-miR-301b is involved 

in the pathogenesis of cancer in both pancreatic cancer and 

thyroid papillary carcinoma.38,39

In this study, the specific molecular pathogenesis of 

hsa-miR-301b’s involvement in breast cancer needs further 

investigation. miRNAs regulate gene expression mainly by 

inducing targeted mRNA degradation. In this study, we identi-

fied a total of three mRNAs (KPNA2, NTRK2, and SFRP1) 

that have been shown to be associated with the prognosis 

of invasive breast cancer. KPNA2 has been found to play a 

role in altering cell phenotype and carcinogenesis. Through 

immunohistochemical evaluation and long-term follow-up of 

1,494 invasive breast cancer patients, it was found that KPNA2 

expression was associated with the negative estrogen recep-

tor and triple-negative phenotype. Survival analysis showed 

that KPNA2 expression was associated with a poor prognosis 

(P<0.0001).40 Studies have found that miR-200c is essential 
for maintaining the characteristics, behavior, and sensitivity 

to chemotherapy in invasive breast cancer epithelial cells.

NTRK2, a direct target of miR-200c, codes for proteins 

expressed in mesenchymal or neuron-derived cells and may

contribute to the relative risk for symptom burden during and 

shortly after the period of chemotherapy in women with early-

stage breast cancer.41–43 Li et al,44 using the gene microarray 

analysis, found that miR-105/93-3p activates Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling by the downregulation of SFRP1, thereby promot-

ing stem cells, chemoresistance, and TNBC cell metastasis. 

The has-miR-542-5p is a predictive biomarker and potential 

target for the treatment of breast cancer patients. Studies 

have confirmed that has-miR-542-5p functions through a 

mechanism involving its target gene SFRP1.45 Therefore, 

KPNA2, NTRK2, and SFRP1 are involved in the pathogenesis, 

infiltration, and metastasis of invasive breast cancer.

It is worth noting that based on the ceRNA network, 

we compared and identified nine biomarkers related to 

the prognosis of invasive breast cancer. We obtained a 

meaningful lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA regulatory axis, 

namely, LINC00466–hsa-mir-204–NTRK2. This suggests 

that LINC00466, hsa-mir-204, and NTRK2 are involved in 

the molecular mechanism of invasive breast cancer, while

ceRna networks in invasive breast cancer

 discovery of this axis provides new insights into the molecular 

mechanisms of invasive breast cancer and may provide new 

approaches to its treatment.

Conclusion
In this study, we first constructed an invasive breast cancer-

associated ceRNA network consisting of 90 DElncRNAs, 

18 DEmiRNAs, and 26 DEmRNAs. Based on the total 

survival analysis, we obtained a total of nine prognostic 

biomarkers associated with invasive breast cancer, includ-

ing AC007731, AL356479, LINC00460, LINC00466, 

hsa-mir-204, hsa-mir-301b, KPNA2, NTRK2, and SFRP1. 

We obtained a LINC00466–hsa-mir-204–NTRK2 axis that 

correlates with the treatment and prognosis of invasive 

breast cancer through comparative integration. This fur-

ther demonstrates the contribution of lncRNA, miRNA, 

and mRNA interactions to the pathogenesis of invasive 

breast cancer. This study further investigated the molecular 

pathogenesis of invasive breast cancer and provides new 

diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that can be used to 

guide the treatment and in-depth study of invasive breast 

cancer.
